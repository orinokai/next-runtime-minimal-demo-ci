This is a starter [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to test the Next.js Minimal Runtime.

## Getting Started

Recommended setup:

1. Download this project to a new directory and open in a new [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) workspace.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `ntl sites:create` to link the project to a site for testing.

After setting up the site, ensure you have the [Next.js Minimal Runtime](https://github.com/netlify/next-minimal-runtime) project in an adjacent directory and add it to the workspace so you can work on both together.

## Development

After making changes to the Next.js Minimal Runtime, run one of the build tasks (build, deploy or serve) to test your changes with this demo project. You can do this by running the `Tasks: Run Task` command in VSCode or with the Cmd+Shift+B shortcut.

## Debugging

To debug the Next.js Minimal Runtime, set a breakpoint in the source code and run the `Debug: Start Debugging` command in VSCode or use the F5 shortcut. This will start a build of the demo site with the runtime and attach the VSCode debugger to it.
